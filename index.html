	<p>"The Man Who Sold The World"
(originally by David Bowie)

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land [Alt: I searched for foreign land]
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here [Alt 1: We walked a million years]
[Alt 2: With multimillionaires]
[Alt 3: We walked a million hills]
I must have died alone [Alt: I must have died along]
A long, long time ago

Who knows?
Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows?
Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
